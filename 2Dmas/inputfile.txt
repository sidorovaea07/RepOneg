ALEXANDER PUSHKIN
  
   EUGENE ONEGIN
  
   A Novel in Verse
  
  
  
  
   With no intention to entertain,
   In love with friendship and regard,
   What I would like is to explain
   A pledge that's worthy of your heart,
   That's worthy of the soul unsmeared,
   Of sacred and completed dream,
   Poetic feelings, loud and clear,
   Of lofty thoughts and easy mien;
   But sorry, with a hand that's biased
   Accept the heap of patchy drafts,
   Half-laughable, half-downhearted
   Uneducated, undivided,
   Capricious fruit of joyful laughs,
   Of sleepless nights and inspirations,
   Of immature and withered years,
   Of mind's cold observations
   And sole's pitiful concerns.
  
  
   CHAPTER ONE
  
   I.
  
   My uncle of the highest codes,
   When he became very ill,
   He claimed respect from all his folks,
   And there was no better deal.
   He is exemplary for others,
   But, don't tell me how it bothers
   To nurse a dummy day and night
   With no single step aside!
   It is so vicious to beguile,
   To entertain a moron,
   To serve him medicine with a smile
   To straighten pillows with a moan,
   To sigh while thinking: all goes well:
   Be quick and go straight to hell.

   That was the young heartbreaker's vision
   While riding stagecoach in the mud,
   By Jove's excellent decision
   Being heir to all ancestral blood.
   Supporters of my previous glory
   With hero of this novel story
   Not waiting for another chance
   Let me acquaint you at once.
   Onegin was my close buddy,
   Who lived on Northern river shore
   Where also you may have been born
   Or showed brilliance in study.
   I thither had my better days,
   But in the North I have no grace.

   Although serving very nobly,
   His father lived in great default,
   Three banquets celebrated yearly
   And his finances went to naught.
   Eugeni's fate was very kind:
   A French Madame for him was hired,
   To be replaced by the Monsieur.
   The child was brisk and very fair.
   Not to exhaust the poor kid,
   Monsieur l'Abbe, a shabby bloke
   Regarded teaching as a joke,
   His words were never very strict,
   The boy was scolded and pardoned
   And daily walked to Summer Garden.

   And when of stormy youth and anguish
   The time came to Eugene,
   The time of hopes and tender languish,
   Monsieur was driven from the scene.
   At last, Eugene is liberated
   His hair stylishly updated,
   Dressed like a dandy at the court,
   He finally could see the world.
   His French was fine to perfection,
   He could explain himself and write;
   Could easily Mazurka stride
   And bowed smartly at receptions;
   What more? The world resolved at once
   That he was smart and very nice.
