ALEXANDER PUSHKIN
  
   EUGENE ONEGIN
  
   A Novel in Verse
  
  
  
  
   With no intention to entertain,
   In love with friendship and regard,
   What I would like is to explain
   A pledge that's worthy of your heart,
   That's worthy of the soul unsmeared,
   Of sacred and completed dream,
   Poetic feelings, loud and clear,
   Of lofty thoughts and easy mien;
   But sorry, with a hand that's biased
   Accept the heap of patchy drafts,
   Half-laughable, half-downhearted
   Uneducated, undivided,
   Capricious fruit of joyful laughs,
   Of sleepless nights and inspirations,
   Of immature and withered years,
   Of mind's cold observations
   And sole's pitiful concerns.
  
  
   CHAPTER ONE
  
   I.
  
   My uncle of the highest codes,
   When he became very ill,
   He claimed respect from all his folks,
   And there was no better deal.
   He is exemplary for others,
   But, don't tell me how it bothers
   To nurse a dummy day and night
   With no single step aside!
   It is so vicious to beguile,
   To entertain a moron,
   To serve him medicine with a smile
   To straighten pillows with a moan,
   To sigh while thinking: all goes well:
   Be quick and go straight to hell.
