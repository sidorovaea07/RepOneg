My uncle of the highest codes,
When he became very ill,
He claimed respect from all his folks
And there was no better deal.
He is exemplary for others,
But, don't tell me how it bothers
To nurse a dummy day and night
With no single step aside!
It is so vicious to beguile,
To entertain a moron,
To serve him medicine with a smile
To straighten pillows with a moan,
To sigh while thinking: all goes well:
Be quick and go straight to hell.
